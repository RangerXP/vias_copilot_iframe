# Development Plan — MSIE PBIE Context-Aware AI Assistant

## Project Framing

**Pattern 1 — Context Injection Agent** from the VISA PBI Embedded build guide is the target implementation.

The objective is to build and demo a local PBIE server where:
- An iframe renders a live report from a **Fabric semantic model**
- A chat panel captures report state and sends it to a **Foundry Agent**
- The **Fabric Data Agent** executes semantic queries grounded in the visible report context
- Responses are returned in natural language to the chat panel

---

## Phase Map

```
Phase 0: Model Discovery + Local Server Scaffold
Phase 1: Iframe Render + Context Capture
Phase 2: Fabric Data Agent Integration
Phase 3: Foundry Agent + Context Injection (Pattern 1)
Phase 4: Semantic Query Layer (Production Pattern)
Phase 5: Demo Build
```

---

## Sprint 1 — Local PBIE Server + Fabric Model Registration

**Goal:** Prove we can render a Fabric-backed report in an iframe on a locally-hosted Node.js server.

**Inputs:**
- Fabric workspace ID (from model discovery)
- Target semantic model / report ID
- PBIE embed token (App-Owns-Data flow)

**Deliverables:**
- [x] `server/index.js` — Express server that serves the embed token and HTML shell
- [x] `frontend/index.html` — Iframe host page with `powerbi-client` loaded
- [x] `frontend/embed.js` — Calls `powerbi.embed()` with token from backend; `tokenExpired` refresh with effectiveIdentity preserved
- [x] Iframe renders the target Fabric report locally — **confirmed 2026-07-21**: `/api/embed-token` returns valid token + embedUrl for report `e833a03b`
- [x] `docs/local_server_setup.md` validated (setup steps confirmed working)

**Validation:**
> Report visible in browser at `http://localhost:3000`. No sign-in prompt. Filter pane accessible.
> **STATUS: PASSED** — SP `VISA-PBIE-EmbedService` issues valid embed tokens via `server/routes/embedToken.js`.

**Fabric Model Reference:**
- See [docs/fabric_model_discovery.md](docs/fabric_model_discovery.md) to identify workspace + report IDs
- See [semantic/model_metadata.md](semantic/model_metadata.md) for discovered model schema

---

## Sprint 2 — Context Capture Layer

**Goal:** Capture current report state from the iframe and produce a structured JSON context object.

**Pattern 1 source:** `build_guide.md` — Phase 1 Deliverable

**Deliverables:**
- [x] `frontend/context-capture/captureContext.js` — reads PBIE state
- [x] Captures: `reportId`, `page`, `filters`, `slicers`, `selections`
- [x] Serializes to clean JSON
- [x] POST to `server/routes/context.js` endpoint (confirmed 200 round-trip)
- [x] Context flows through to `/api/chat` as `rawContext` → normalized → injected into Foundry agent user turn — confirmed via `[Report Context]` block in `chat.js`

**Output shape:**
```json
{
  "reportId": "...",
  "page": "...",
  "filters": [],
  "slicers": [],
  "visualSelections": []
}
```

**Validation:**
> Change a slicer in the embedded report. Trigger context capture. JSON reflects the new slicer state.

---

## Sprint 3 — Fabric Data Agent Integration

**Goal:** Wire the Fabric Data Agent as the semantic query engine for the agent backend.

**Pattern source:** build_guide.md — Phase 4 (Semantic Model Query Layer, moved earlier given Fabric native agent)

**Deliverables:**
- [x] Fabric Data Agent (`Commercial_Spend_Agent`) provisioned — **but has no public REST query endpoint** (CRUD-only Fabric API, confirmed by exhaustive endpoint probing)
- [x] **Pivoted** to direct Power BI `executeQueries` REST API against the semantic model (`server/services/fabricAgent.js`) — same grounded-query outcome, different transport
- [x] Query interface implemented: `queryFabricAgent({ question, context, daxQuery }) → JSON string` (summary/trend/segment DAX shapes auto-selected by question pattern)
- [x] Auth: `DefaultAzureCredential` (delegated user token) — SP client-credentials blocked by tenant Power BI admin setting ("Allow service principals to use Power BI APIs" not enabled)
- [x] `docs/fabric_agent_config.md` — needs update to reflect the executeQueries pivot (doc still describes original Data Agent REST plan)

**Validation:**
> POST `{ "question": "What is the total spend and transaction count?" }` to `/api/chat`. Agent returns a grounded answer from real semantic model data.
> **STATUS: PASSED** — confirmed live 2026-07-21: "$74,812,278.37 ... 250,000 transactions ... $299.25 per transaction."

---

## Sprint 4 — Foundry Agent + Context Injection (Pattern 1 Core)

**Goal:** Build the Pattern 1 Foundry Agent that accepts context + question and returns grounded answers via the Fabric Data Agent as a tool.

**Pattern source:** build_guide.md — Phase 3 Deliverable

**Deliverables:**
- [x] Azure AI Foundry Agent created — `pbie-context-agent` (`asst_0VlPo0xeZeprd75h0Jve0a5l`), model `gpt-5.1`, project `visa-pbie-context` (West US 3 — `visa-pbie-context-rsc`)
- [x] Tool: `query_semantic_model(question, context)` — implemented in `server/services/foundryAgent.js` with tool call dispatch loop
- [x] `server/services/foundryAgent.js` — Foundry SDK (`@azure/ai-agents` v1.x sub-client API: `agents.threads`, `agents.messages`, `agents.runs`) with `requires_action` polling and tool routing to `fabricAgent.js`
- [x] Chat panel wired: user message → context capture → Foundry Agent → response
- [x] Agent synthesizes natural-language answers from tool JSON (system prompt enforces synthesis; client-side fallback synthesizer in `foundryAgent.js` as a safety net)
- [ ] `docs/pattern1_iframe_injection.md` — full injection flow documented (update after live validation)

**Known SDK gotcha (resolved):** `@azure/ai-agents` v1.x replaced the old flat `createThread/createMessage/createRun/listMessages` methods with sub-clients (`agents.threads.create()`, `agents.messages.create(threadId, role, content)`, `agents.runs.create(threadId, assistantId)`, `agents.runs.submitToolOutputs(threadId, runId, toolOutputsArray)`). Also: `USE_FOUNDRY` in `chat.js` must be evaluated inside the request handler, not at module load, since ESM imports are hoisted before `dotenv.config()` runs.

**System Prompt Template:**
```
You are an embedded analytics assistant for a Power BI Embedded report.

The user is currently viewing:
{{context_block}}

Use the semantic model query tool to answer data questions.
Respond in plain language aligned with the visible report state.
Do not answer from memory. Always query the model for data values.
```

**Validation:**
> User selects Merchant = Costco in slicer. Types "Why are declines increasing?" Context injected. Agent responds with model-grounded answer about Costco.

## Sprint 5 — Semantic Query Layer Refinement

**Goal:** Improve Fabric Data Agent query quality — add DAX examples, field mappings, and context translation.

**Pattern source:** build_guide.md — Phase 2 (Context Service) + Phase 4 (Query Layer)

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `semantic/dax/` — example DAX patterns for agent tool calls
- [ ] `semantic/metadata/field_map.json` — PBIE field name → business name mapping
- [ ] Context service middleware: normalize PBIE state to business-friendly context
- [ ] Multi-page context (page transitions preserved in conversation)

**Validation:**
> Ask multi-turn questions across two pages. Context is coherent across turns. Field names are human-readable in all responses.

---

## Sprint 6 — Demo Build + Talking Points

**Goal:** Produce a repeatable demo that tells the Pattern 1 story for PG review and stakeholder showcase.

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `docs/demo_script.md` — step-by-step demo flow with talking points
- [ ] Demo report identified in Fabric (specific pages + slicers defined)
- [ ] Demo questions scripted and tested against live agent
- [ ] README updated with final architecture diagram

**Demo Questions (Draft):**
1. "What am I looking at?" — tests context summary
2. "Why did approval rates decrease?" — tests trend analysis with context
3. "Show me the highest risk merchant in this view." — tests filter-aware ranking
4. "Explain this chart." — tests page-aware visual description

## Open Questions

| # | Question | Owner | Status |
|---|----------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Which Fabric workspace/semantic model to target? | Sean | **RESOLVED — VISA workspace, Visa Slicer Demo v2** |
| 2 | Is a Fabric Data Agent already provisioned for this model? | Sean | Open |
| 3 | App-Owns-Data service principal created in tenant? | Sean | Open — register in MngEnvMCAP660444 |
| 4 | Azure AI Foundry project available or needs creation? | Sean | Open |
| 5 | Is Premium Per User or embedded capacity available for embed tokens? | Sean | **RESOLVED — dedicated capacity cb113ec9** |

## Risk Register

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Fabric Data Agent not available for target model | Fallback: Direct XMLA/REST query to semantic model via service principal |
| Embed token scope insufficient for Fabric-backed reports | Validate capacity license; use PPU if needed |
| Context object too large for prompt window | Implement context compression in context service |
| Fabric model field names opaque for prompt grounding | Use field_map.json to translate before injection |
